Contributing to TraceBack
=======================

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We welcome bug reports, feature
requests, documentation improvements, and pull requests from anyone.

How to contribute
-----------------

1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your change: `git checkout -b`.
2. Keep changes small and focused. One feature or fix per PR.
3. Write clear commit messages and reference relevant issues in the PR body.
4. Run any existing tests and linting (if applicable) before opening a PR.

Reporting issues
----------------

- Use the issue tracker to report bugs or request features.
- Provide a short description, steps to reproduce, actual vs expected behavior,
  and any relevant logs or configuration.

Pull request checklist
----------------------

- [ ] My patch follows the project's coding style.
- [ ] I have added/updated documentation where relevant.
- [ ] I have tested my changes (basic smoke test).
- [ ] The PR description explains the motivation and what changed.

Code style and testing
----------------------

This project is written in Lua for use as a Neovim plugin. Please follow the
existing project style when editing files under `lua/` and `plugin/`.

If you add functionality, include a short manual test or automated test if
appropriate. If you need help setting up a test environment, open an issue and
we'll help.

Communication
-------------

If you plan to do larger work, open an issue first to discuss the design and
avoid duplicated effort.

Thank you for helping improve TraceBack!
